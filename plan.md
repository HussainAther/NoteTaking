## notes to myself to plan and create the project

Set up a new Flask project: Create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment for Python. Install Flask using pip.

Define the Flask routes: Create a routes.py file and define the routes for different pages of your application. For example, you can have routes for home, registration, login, creating notes, and uploading files.

Design the HTML templates: Create HTML templates for each route using Flask's template engine (Jinja2). You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to enhance the design and styling of your application.

Implement user registration and login: Create forms and views to handle user registration and login functionality. You can use Flask-WTF extension for form validation and Flask-Login extension to manage user sessions.

Set up a database: Choose a database system like SQLite or PostgreSQL to store user information, notes, and file metadata. Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like SQLAlchemy to interact with the database in your Flask application.

Create note creation and file upload functionality: Implement forms and views to allow users to create new notes and upload files associated with those notes. You can use Flask-WTF's FileField to handle file uploads.

Display and manage user notes: Create views to display a user's notes and allow them to edit or delete their own notes.

Deploy your Flask application on Glitch: Sign up for a Glitch account and create a new project. Copy your Flask project files into the Glitch project and customize the start script in the package.json file to run your Flask application.

Test and iterate: Test your application locally to ensure everything is working as expected. Make necessary improvements and iterate on your design and functionality.
